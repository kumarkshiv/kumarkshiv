- 👋 Hi, I’m Shiv Kumar
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Defined Network(SDN) and Network systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently in the 3rd year of my PhD(Computer Science) at IIT Hyderabad under Dr. Praveen Tammana.[(Link)](https://praveenabt.github.io/)
- 🌱 I have knowledge of P4 language for data-plane programming in SDN.
- 🌱 I also have knowledge of eBPF/XDP and the internals of the eBPF subsystem of Linux.
- 💞️ I’m working on a project which revolves around eBPF and Compilers (extended Berkeley Packet Filter). I am curious to learn more about eBPF and it's interesting usecases.
