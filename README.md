- 👋 Hi, I’m Shiv Kumar
- 👀 I’m interested in Programmable Networks and Systems.
- 🌱 I’m have completed 4 years of PhD research (degree conferred as MS) at IIT Hyderabad ([NETX Lab](https://www.netxiith.in/)).
- 🌱 I have knowledge of P4 language for data-plane programming in SDN.
- 🌱 I also have knowledge of eBPF/XDP and the internals of the eBPF subsystem of Linux.
- 💞️ I have worked on multiple research projects around network programmability like P4, eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) and Compilers. I am curious to learn more about eBPF and its interesting use-cases (e.g., Cloud Native Network Functions, Observability, Performance monitoring in the Data centers, etc. ).
